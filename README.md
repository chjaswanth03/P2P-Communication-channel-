# P2P-Communication-channel- a Vintage Interface look
# Local Network Collaboration App

This project is a real-time collaboration app designed to work over a local Wi-Fi network. The app enables peer-to-peer communication using a 4-digit Peer ID system, allowing users to exchange messages in real-time.

## Features

- **4-Digit Peer ID System:** Each user gets a unique 4-digit ID to connect with others on the same Wi-Fi network.
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Send and receive messages instantly between peers.
- **Usernames:** Customize your username to identify yourself in the chat.
- **Message Formatting:** Supports basic text formatting (e.g., bold and italics).
- **Persistent Chat History:** Saves chat history locally, so you won’t lose messages on page refresh.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Frontend framework used for building the user interface.
- **PeerJS:** Used for establishing peer-to-peer communication over WebRTC.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For creating a responsive and modern UI design.
